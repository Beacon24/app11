Version 0.11 of the Beacon App


    Hi, I'm Jared, and I'm working on programming a social network utility devoted to community connection and action, instead of profits and capturing attention. 
      ~Read more about what I'm working on at www.thebeaconnetwork.org.
      
       I'm a novice programmer putting this together by myself until I find the people to help me. 
          Right now we have a limited budget but are increasing our fundraising outreach this year. 
          Eventually we hope to hire experienced programmers to guide and support app development. 
          In the meantime any voluntary help as I write this code on my own is appreciated!
      
      I'm writing Beacon in ... Javascript, node, express, mongo, and mongoose, with Mapbox-GLJS for some main features.
      
      I’m currently working on ... Finishing the basic schemas and CRUD functions of inititial app. 
      Soon to be learning how to implement search/filtering of users, groups, and initiatives, with display on mapbox map.

      I’m looking for ... More experienced programmers who see the meritts of this project or just want to help out a newbie. 
      Getting through bugs and breaks is easier with support, so having some folks willing to point me in the right direction, 
      maybe have a conversation now and then, would speed me along my way. 
      And if you're looking to volunteer your time for a non-profit organization and mission, 
      I would happily share some of the technical load.
 
      How to reach me ... jdubin@thebeaconnetwork.org. Check out our website, thebeaconnetwork.org.
